GameHub is a React-based web application that serves as an interactive game database, allowing users to explore and discover information about various games. The application is powered by the RAWG API, which provides access to a vast collection of game-related data, including release dates and game names. GameHub offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface that enables gamers and enthusiasts to search for, view, and learn more about their favorite games.

The RAWG API will serve as the primary data source for the application. It will be utilized to fetch game information, including release dates and names, which will be dynamically displayed on the frontend.
The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across different devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
